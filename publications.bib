                   Laboratories workshop, held in Denver on November 7-8, 2024,
                   brought together leading experts from materials science and
                   computing to address the growing need to revolutionize
                   scientific research through AI-driven autonomous laboratories.
                   The workshop identified critical challenges, including the
                   integration of heterogeneous data, development of AI systems
                   that understand fundamental physical principles, and
                   comprehensive safety protocols. Key recommendations emerged
                   around developing universal laboratory equipment interfaces,
                   implementing automated metadata collection systems, and
                   creating hybrid AI approaches that combine data-driven
                   learning with scientific principles. The workshop
                   emphasized maintaining human oversight while leveraging
                   automation, transforming scientific education to prepare the
                   next generation of researchers, and establishing a national
                   consortium leveraging DOE facilities as anchors for broader
                   collaboration with academia and industry. Participants
                   stressed the urgency of addressing the growing disconnect
                   between human decision-making timescales and modern
                   instrumentation capabilities, highlighting the need for
                   strategic automation while preserving essential human insight
                   and oversight in the research process."

                   management systems, across many distributed organizations and

                   construct interconnected science ecosystems, review how the
                   INTERSECT software development kit eases microservice
                   capability development, and demonstrate the use of such
                   capabilities for deploying an example multi-facility
