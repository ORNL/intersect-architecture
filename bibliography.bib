  abstract = "{ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 addresses the creation, analysis and
          sustainment of architectures of systems through the use of
          architecture descriptions. A conceptual model of architecture
          description is established. The required contents of an
          architecture description are specified. Architecture viewpoints,
          architecture frameworks and architecture description languages are
          introduced for codifying conventions and common practices of
          architecture description. The required content of architecture
          viewpoints, architecture frameworks and architecture description
          languages is specified. Annexes provide the motivation and
          background for key concepts and terminology and examples of
          applying ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011.}",
