                   commercial workflow management systems point to different
                   insights of suitability and different levels of expressive
                   power. The challenge, which we undertake in this paper, is to
                   systematically address workflow requirements, from basic to
                   complex. Many of the more complex requirements identified,
                   recur quite frequently in the analysis phases of workflow
                   projects, however their implementation is uncertain in
                   current products. Requirements for workflow languages are
                   indicated through workflow patterns. In this context,
                   patterns address business requirements in an imperative
                   workflow style expression, but are removed from specific
                   workflow languages. The paper describes a number of workflow
                   patterns addressing what we believe identify comprehensive
                   workflow functionality. These patterns provide the basis for
                   an in-depth comparison of a number of commercially available
                   work flow management systems. As such, this paper can be
                   seen as the academic response to evaluations made by
                   prestigious consulting companies. Typically, these
                   evaluations hardly consider the workflow modeling language
                   and routing capabilities, and focus more on the purely
                   technical and commercial aspects."

Reusing and re-purposing workflows allow scientists to do new experiments faster, since the workflows capture useful expertise from others. As workflow libraries grow, scientists face the challenge of finding workflows appropriate for their task, understanding what each workflow does, and reusing relevant portions of a given workflow. We believe that workflows would be easier to understand and reuse if high-level views (abstractions) of their activities were available in workflow libraries. As a first step towards obtaining these abstractions, we report in this paper on the results of a manual analysis performed over a set of real-world scientific workflows from Taverna, Wings, Galaxy and Vistrails. Our analysis has resulted in a set of scientific workflow motifs that outline (i) the kinds of data-intensive activities that are observed in workflows (Data-Operation motifs), and (ii) the different manners in which activities are implemented within workflows (Workflow-Oriented motifs). These motifs are helpful to identify the functionality of the steps in a given workflow, to develop best practices for workflow design, and to develop approaches for automated generation of workflow abstractions.}

abstract = {Summary
Powerful detectors at modern experimental facilities routinely collect data at multiple GB/s. Online analysis methods are needed to enable the collection of only interesting subsets of such massive data streams, such as by explicitly discarding some data elements or by directing instruments to relevant areas of experimental space. Thus, methods are required for configuring and running distributed computing pipelines—what we call flows—that link instruments, computers (e.g., for analysis, simulation, artificial intelligence [AI] model training), edge computing (e.g., for analysis), data stores, metadata catalogs, and high-speed networks. We review common patterns associated with such flows and describe methods for instantiating these patterns. We present experiences with the application of these methods to the processing of data from five different scientific instruments, each of which engages powerful computers for data inversion,model training, or other purposes. We also discuss implications of such methods for operators and users of scientific facilities.}

  abstract      = "Reliability is a serious concern for future extreme-scale
                   high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Projections based
                   on the current generation of HPC systems and technology
                   roadmaps suggest the prevalence of very high fault rates in
                   future systems. The errors resulting from these faults will
                   propagate and generate various kinds of failures, which may
                   result in outcomes ranging from result corruptions to
                   catastrophic application crashes. Therefore, the resilience
                   challenge for extreme-scale HPC systems requires coordination
                   between various hardware and software technologies that are
                   capable of handling a broad set of fault models at
                   accelerated fault rates. Also, due to practical limits on
                   power consumption in future HPC systems, they are likely to
                   embrace innovative architectures, increasing the levels of
                   hardware and software complexities. Therefore, the
                   techniques that seek to improve resilience must navigate the
                   complex trade-off space between resilience and the overheads
                   to power consumption and performance. While the HPC community
                   has developed various resilience solutions, application-level
                   techniques as well as system-based solutions, the solution
                   space of HPC resilience techniques remains fragmented. There
                   are no formal methods to integrate the various HPC resilience
                   techniques into composite solutions, nor are there methods to
                   holistically evaluate the adequacy and efficacy of such
                   solutions in terms of their protection coverage, and their
                   performance & power efficiency characteristics. Additionally,
                   few implementations of current resilience solutions are
                   portable to newer architectures and software environments that
                   will be deployed on future systems.
                   We developed a new structured approach to the management of
                   HPC resilience using the concept of resilience-based design
                   patterns. In general, a design pattern is a repeatable
                   solution to a commonly occurring problem. We identified the
                   well-known solutions that are commonly used to deal with
                   faults, errors and failures in HPC systems. In the initial
                   design patterns specification (version 1.0), we described
                   the various solutions, which address specific problems in
                   the design of resilient HPC environments, in the form of
                   patterns. Each pattern describes a problem caused by a fault,
                   error or failure event in an HPC environment, and then
                   describes the core of the solution of the problem in such a
                   way that this solution may be adapted to different systems
                   and implemented at different layers of the system stack. The
                   catalog of these resilience design patterns provides
                   designers with a collection of design elements. To construct
                   complete resilience solutions using combinations of various
                   patterns, we defined a framework that enhances HPC designers'
                   understanding of the important constraints and the
                   opportunities for the design patterns to be implemented and
                   deployed at various layers of the system stack. The design
                   framework is also useful for establishing interfaces and
                   mechanisms to coordinate flexible fault management across
                   hardware and software components, as well as to consider the
                   trade-off between performance, resilience, and power
                   consumption when constructing a solution. The resilience
                   design patterns specification version 1.1 included more
                   detailed explanations of the pattern solutions, the context
                   in which the patterns are applicable, and the implications
                   for hardware or software design. It also provided several
                   additional examples and detailed case studies to demonstrate
                   the use of patterns to build realistic solutions.
                   In this version 1.2 of the specification document, we have
                   improved the pattern descriptions, including graphical
                   representations of the pattern components. These
                   improvements are largely based on critical comments,
                   feedback and suggestions received from pattern experts and
                   readers of the previous versions of the specification. The
                   pattern classification has been modified to further clarify
                   the relationships between pattern categories. This version
                   of the specification also introduces a pattern language for
                   resilience design patterns. The pattern language presents
                   the patterns in the catalog as a network, revealing the
                   relations among the resilience patterns. The language
                   provides designers with the means to explore alternative
                   techniques for handling a specific fault model that may have
                   different efficiency and complexity characteristics. Using
                   the pattern language also enables the design and
                   implementation of comprehensive resilience solutions as a
                   set of interconnected resilience patterns that can be
                   instantiated across layers of the system stack. The overall
                   goal of this work is to provide hardware and software
                   designers, as well as the users and operators of HPC systems,
                   a systematic methodology for the design and evaluation of
                   resilience technologies in HPC systems that keep scientific
                   applications running to a correct solution in a timely and
                   cost-efficient manner despite frequent faults, errors, and
                   failures of various types.
                   Version 2.0 expands the resilience design pattern
                   classification and catalog to include self-stabilization
                   patterns and reliability, availability and performance models
                   for each structural pattern."
