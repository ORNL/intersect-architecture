Classification of Microservices
###############################

The format used to document microservice capabilities is described
in :ref:`intersect:arch:ms:class:capability-format`. In the
following two sections that focus on microservice capabilities for
infrastructure services
(:ref:`intersect:arch:ms:class:infrastructure`) and
experiment-specific services
(:ref:`intersect:arch:ms:class:experiment`), we classify
capabilities into groups based on their general purpose, such as
computation or data management for infrastructure services, and
experimental control or design for experiment-specific services.
