Integrated Research Infrastructure Architecture
###############################################

The :term:`DOE` :term:`Office of Science (SC)<DOE-SC>` has mapped out a vision
:cite:`IRI:2023` for an :term:`Integrated Research Infrastructure (IRI)<IRI>`
Architecture "to empower researchers to meld :term:`DOE`'s world-class
research tools, infrastructure, and user facilities seamlessly and securely in
novel ways to radically accelerate discovery and innovation." It seeks to
connect experimental facilities with :term:`high-performance computing
(HPC) <HPC>` resources for near real-time analysis and for merging enormous and
diverse data sets for :term:`AI`\ /\ :term:`ML` techniques and analysis. To
implement this vision, an integrated research ecosystem is needed that
transforms science via seamless interoperability. While individual localized
solutions for specific science workflows exist, a multifacility solution for
integrative science is required that avoids duplication, maximizes efficiency,
and offers scalability across disciplines and domains.

In 2022, the :term:`DOE-SC` :term:`Advanced Scientific Computing Research
(ASCR)<ASCR>` program conducted an Architecture Blueprint Activity for the
envisioned :term:`IRI` to produce a reference framework for a coordinated
strategy. The activity involved over 150 experts from all 28 :term:`DOE-SC`
user facilities across 13 national laboratories. It defined six
:ref:`intersect:arch:iri:practice` and three :ref:`intersect:arch:iri:patterns`.
