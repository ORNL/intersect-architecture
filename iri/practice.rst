Practice Areas
--------------

The :term:`IRI` Architecture Blueprint Activity defined the following six
practice areas (cross-cutting communities of practice whose efforts will be
essential to advance robust and extensible :term:`IRI` designs and solutions)
:cite:`IRI:2023`:

- **User experience practice** will ensure relentless attention to user
  perspectives and needs through requirements gathering, user-centric
  (co)-design, continuous feedback, and other means.

- **Resource co-operations practice** is focused on creating new modes of
  cooperation, collaboration, co-scheduling, and joint planning across
  facilities and :term:`DOE` programs.

- **Cybersecurity and federated access practice** is focused on creating novel
  solutions that enable seamless scientific collaboration within a secure and
  trusted :term:`IRI` ecosystem.

- **Workflows, interfaces, and automation practice** is focused on creating
  novel solutions that facilitate the dynamic assembly of components across
  facilities into end-to-end :term:`IRI` pipelines.

- **Scientific data life cycle practice** is focused on ensuring that users
  can manage their data and metadata across facilities from inception to
  curation, archiving, dissemination, and publication.

- **Portable/scalable solutions practice** is focused on ensuring that
  transitions can be made across heterogeneous facilities (portability) and
  from smaller to larger resources (scalability).
