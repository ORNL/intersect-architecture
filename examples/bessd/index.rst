Multi-scale Biological and Environmental Solutions for a Sustainable Earth
==========================================================================

The 10-year grand challenge in biological and environmental systems science is
to mitigate the existential threats of disturbance and climate change on
natural and managed ecosystems. This challenge can be best addressed by
designing a flexible and multi-scale observation-experiment-modeling
integration framework for integrated laboratory, greenhouse, and field
experiments. Integrating currently independent capabilities in cross-scale
experimental systems and modeling enables efficient, economical, and
enlightening studies across a range of temporal and spatial scales, in natural
and managed ecosystems. Such studies ensure sustainable life on Earth with
clean energy and resilient biological, environmental, and human systems.

This project develops an exemplar multi-scale observation-experiment-modeling
platform that leverages :term:`INTERSECT` federated ecosystem to address two
key questions: 1) how can plant genotypes be used to predict resilience to
increased temperature due to climate change, and 2) how can soil greenhouse gas
emissions be impacted by resilient plant traits? It collects and transfers data
from multi-scale laboratory, greenhouse, and field manipulation studies for
modeling simulations in the :term:`INTERSECT` federated ecosystem to predict
genes underlying plant resilience traits, and the effect of those genes on soil
C dynamics under enhanced warming. The results enable feedback experiment
steering and design, with the long-term goal for live feedback to experimental
manipulations in future studies.

The overarching objective is to develop capabilities for a multi-scale
observation-experiment-modeling integration framework, enabled by the
:term:`INTERSECT` federated ecosystem to facilitate data transfer, analysis,
simulation, and experiment steering and design. This project has the following
3 :ref:`intersect:arch:examples:bessd:objectives`:

-  :ref:`intersect:arch:examples:bessd:phenotyping`: Discovering the genetics of
   resilient plant traits by integrating high-frequency phenotyping with
   measurements of photosynthesis and :term:`volatile organic compound<VOC>`
   emissions.
-  :ref:`intersect:arch:examples:bessd:soilcosm`: Towards an automated soil
   microcosm with model-experiment feedback.
-  :ref:`intersect:arch:examples:bessd:co2flux`: Integrating automated
   CO\ :sub:`2` flux measurement systems into field-scale experiments to reduce
   uncertainties in C-flux responses to thermal extremes.
