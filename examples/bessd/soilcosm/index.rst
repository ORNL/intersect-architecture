SoilCosm Galaxy
===============

The goal within this objective is to advance understanding of controls on soil
carbon storage and greenhouse gas production using a soil microcosm system
linked to a predictive model framework. This project will expand the
capabilities of SoilCosms, an automated monitoring of soil incubation
experiments, involving continuous measurement of greenhouse gases. Gas
analyzers will be combined into a testbed hardware design where near real-time
monitoring is used to guide discrete sampling events for characterization of
soil carbon and microbiology pools based on forecasting methods and anomaly
detection. SoilCosm data will be contextualized by comparing to a simple soil
carbon simulation model (DayCent model) using the :term:`INTERSECT` federated
ecosystem and Galaxy workflows
(:numref:`intersect:arch:examples:bessd:soilcosm:soilcosm`).
