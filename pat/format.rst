Format of a Science Use Case Design Pattern
-------------------------------------------

Design patterns for science use cases are expressed in a written form
and in a highly structured format, which permits quick identification of
relevant patterns given a certain problem to be solved and easy
comparison of patterns regarding their applicability and capabilities.
The format for describing science use case design patterns consists of
individual descriptions of pattern properties, including text, diagrams,
and mathematical models. It can be extended over time by adding more
pattern properties and their descriptions. Patterns are described in the
traditional design pattern paradigm: from context to problem to solution
to resulting context. The current science use case design pattern format
is as follows:

Name
   A descriptive name that distinctly identifies the pattern and enables
   designers to think about designs in an abstract manner and communicate
   their design choices to others.

Context
   The preconditions under which the pattern is relevant, including a
   description of the system before the pattern is applied.

Problem
   A description of the problem that provides insight on when it is
   appropriate to apply the pattern. Multiple patterns may address the
   same problem differently.

Forces
   A description of the relevant forces and constraints, and how they
   interact or conflict with each other and with the intended goals and
   objectives.

Solution
   A description of the solution that defines the abstract elements that
   are necessary for the composition of the design solution as well as
   their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations. The specific
   capabilities provided by this pattern.

Resulting Context
   A brief description of the post-conditions arising from the application
   of the pattern. There may be trade-offs between competing optimization
   parameters that arise due to the implementation of a solution using this
   pattern.

Related Patterns
   The relationships between this pattern and other relevant patterns.
   Other patterns may be predecessor or successor patterns. This pattern
   may complement or enhance other patterns. There may also be dependencies
   between patterns to provide a complete solution.

Examples
   A description of one or more examples, including their specific pattern
   properties, that illustrate the use of the pattern for solving concrete
   problems.

Known Uses
   A list of known applications of the pattern in existing systems,
   including any practical considerations and limitations.
