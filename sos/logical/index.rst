Logical View
------------

The logical view addresses the logical composition and interactions between the
different systems in the overall system. By decomposing the overall system into
logical systems, subsystems, services, capabilities, and activities, it
simplifies the overall design and makes it easier to architect the interactions
between the different components. The logical view defines
:ref:`intersect:arch:sos:logical:systems`,
:ref:`intersect:arch:sos:logical:adapters`, and aspects of
:ref:`intersect:arch:sos:logical:errors`.
