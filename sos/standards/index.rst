Standards View
--------------

In the :term:`DoDAF` :cite:`DoDAF2:2010`, the standards view describes the
standards and rules that govern the organization, interaction, and
dependencies between existing and future states of the systems in the
:term:`SoS`. The :term:`INTERSECT` standards view similarly describes the
standards supported by the :term:`INTERSECT` :term:`SoS` architecture in two
different aspects: (1) :ref:`intersect:arch:sos:standards:internal` within
the :term:`INTERSECT` ecosystem that maintain compliance, and (2)
:ref:`intersect:arch:sos:standards:external` that the :term:`INTERSECT`
ecosystem needs to support.

The :term:`INTERSECT` architecture and its corresponding prototype
implementation currently follow an agile software design and development
approach, as many aspects are still open research questions. As standards
are manifestations of stable decisions, the current approach for
:ref:`intersect:arch:sos:standards:internal` focuses on individual per-view
requirements in the :term:`SoS` architecture and on requirements in the
:ref:`intersect:arch:ms`. The current approach for
:ref:`intersect:arch:sos:standards:external` focuses on individual per-project
requirements in the :ref:`intersect:arch:examples`.
