Internal Standards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :term:`INTERSECT` standards view describes the standards supported by the
:term:`INTERSECT` :term:`SoS` architecture in two different aspects: (1)
internal standards within the :term:`INTERSECT` ecosystem that maintain
compliance, and (2) :ref:`intersect:arch:sos:standards:external` that the
:term:`INTERSECT` ecosystem needs to support. The :term:`INTERSECT`
architecture and its corresponding prototype implementation currently follow
an agile software design and development approach, as many aspects are still
open research questions. As standards are manifestations of stable decisions,
the current approach for internal standards focuses on individual per-view
requirements in the :term:`SoS` architecture and on requirements in the
:ref:`intersect:arch:ms`. :ref:`intersect:arch:sos:standards:internal:minimum`
need to be fulfilled to be :term:`INTERSECT` compliant, while
:ref:`intersect:arch:sos:standards:internal:optional` may be fulfilled to
offer additional :term:`INTERSECT`\ -compliant architecture features.
