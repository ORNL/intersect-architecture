User Interfaces
===============

The :ref:`intersect:arch:sos:user` contains conceptual user interfaces for each of the
individual :ref:`intersect:arch:sos:user:roles`. The conceptual user interfaces contain user
view wire diagrams and descriptions for User, Owner, Operator, and Administrator roles (see
:numref:`intersect:arch:sos:user:roles:persontypes` for their definitions).  Any diagrams of
user interfaces are for purposes of illustration and disambiguation of the roles themselves;
they are not intended to reflect or guide the design of application user interfaces.

.. admonition:: Optional requrement
   :name: intersect:arch:sos:user:interfaces:optional

   Optionally, the conceptual user interfaces for each of the individual
   :ref:`intersect:arch:sos:user:roles` are implemented in an easy-to-use :term:`GUI`.

User
----

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:

   user/*

Owner
-----
Once logged into the Home screen in INTERSECT, an Owner would see a few more
top-level views in addition to what the User sees.


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:
      
   owner/*

Operator
--------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:
      
   operator/*

Administrator
-------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:
      
   admin/*
