The Owner is able to see a resource dashboard where they can grant/deny
access of resources to users.

- Granting / denying access to Resource to Users

  - Succinct listing with the following information that can be sorted
    by resource or request date (urgency):

    - Resource

    - Requestor / User

    - Request date

    - Internal identification number

    - Notes

  - Clicking on a request takes the Owner to the User Management Panel
