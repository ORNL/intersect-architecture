Methodologies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* User is notified via email about INTERSECT being ready for the Campaign and is reminded 10-15 minutes before the actual start time
* User logs back into INTERSECT
* User views list of pending Campaigns from the homepage
* User selects appropriate Campaign (perhaps this surfaces up by itself on the home screen so the previous steps can be avoided)
* User elects to start the Campaign when the time to start the Campaign has arrived
* User is shown a list of resources that require them to authenticate / authorize

  - User is taken to the specific resourceâ€™s page to authenticate / authorize
  - This process completes until all resources in the list are fully authenticated /authorized
  - The status needs to be pulled from the resource as opposed to whether or not the User went through INTERSECT to complete the process
  - User views auth tokens / certificates for resources and renews

* User is taken to the running Campaign dashboard view
* User monitors state of running Campaign passively

  - User may be notified out-of-band (email / SMS) according to their configuration
  - User views the live dashboard if they choose to
