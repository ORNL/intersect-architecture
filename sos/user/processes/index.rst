User Processes
==============

The :ref:`intersect:arch:sos:user:processes` contains conceptual processes
which make use of the :ref:`intersect:arch:sos:user:interfaces`. These
processes may not reflect any implemented process by any particular
:term:`INTERSECT` application or installation; rather, they are intended to
further illustrate how user actions will make use of :term:`INTERSECT`
facilities and interfaces.

.. admonition:: Optional requrement
   :name: intersect:arch:sos:user:processes:optional

   Optionally, the conceptual user processes are implemented in an easy-to-use
   :term:`GUI`, using the conceptual :ref:`intersect:arch:sos:user:interfaces`
   as a guide.

Sequence diagrams are included here to illustrate how the different components
of the :term:`INTERSECT` architecture might interact in response to certain
user-initiated actions.
