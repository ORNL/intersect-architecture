User Processes
==============

The :ref:`intersect:arch:sos:user:processes` contains conceptual processes which make use of
the :ref:`intersect:arch:sos:user:interfaces`. These processes may not reflect any implemented
process by any particular INTERSECT application or installation; rather, they are intended to
further illustrate how user actions will make use of INTERSECT facilities and interfaces.

.. admonition:: Optional requrement
   :name: intersect:arch:sos:user:processes:optional

   Optionally, the conceptual user processes are implemented in an easy-to-use :term:`GUI`,
   using the conceptual :ref:`intersect:arch:sos:user:interfaces` as a guide.

Sequence diagrams are included here to illustrate how the different components of the INTERSECT architecture might interact in response to certain user-initiated actions.
